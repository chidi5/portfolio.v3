          In 2018, I tossed my graduation cap into the air after earning my BSc.
          in Computer Engineering. However, my story took an unexpected turn
          when I decided to dive headfirst into the world of entrepreneurship.
          From 2020 onwards, I steered the ship of a bottled water company,
          navigating the challenges of the business world and quenching the
          thirst of the masses.

          Now, I&apos;m back on the tech scene, eager to reunite with my first
          love ðŸ’• - full-stack development. Coding has always been my passion,
          and solving problems is like a thrilling puzzle waiting to be cracked.
          I&apos;ve honed my skills in the entrepreneurial trenches, but the
          allure of crafting sleek, efficient software is pulling me back into
          the world of algorithms and lines of code.

          but also function seamlessly. My journey has taken me from the
          corridors of academia to the boardrooms of startups, and now, I&apos;m
          ready for the next exciting chapter.

          Beyond the keyboard, you&apos;ll find me on the football field,
          chasing a ball with the same enthusiasm I bring to coding. Weekends
          are for soccer, and weekdays are for tackling challenges, both in and
          out of the tech realm. I&apos;m not just a coder; I&apos;m a problem
          solver, a football fanatic, and someone who thrives on embracing new
          challenges.
